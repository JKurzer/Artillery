/**
 Artillery provides an opaque storage optimized containerization for the bristlecone packed input, 
 effectively hiding the complexities from the rest of the system. We will need to refactor this to an abstract 
 class and specialize it for inputs, as M+KB starts to matter. That machinery is best suited to living elsewhere,
 as we work towards supporting remap through reuse of EnhancedInput. While we can't use their event loop, 
 we CAN use everything else in EnhancedInput. Let's be careful not to rewrite it. (oops) We DO need a concept of an
 input having run at least once, though, which is not very idiomatic for Einp.
