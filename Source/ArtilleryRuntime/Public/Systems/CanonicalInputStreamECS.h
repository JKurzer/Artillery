//TODO: finish adding the input streams, replace the local handling in Bristle54 character with references to the input stream ecs
//TODO: begin work on the conceptual frame for reconciling and assessing what input does and does not exist.
//AXIOMS: Input we send is real. Input we get in the batches represents the full knowledge of the server.
//AXIOM: A missed batch means we could be starting to desynchronize.
//AXIOM: Bristlecone Time + the fixed cadencing allows us to know when something SHOULD arrive.
//FACT: A batch missing input of OURS that we believe should be there could mean we are starting to desynchronize.
//FACT: A batch containing input of OURS that we believe should have been in an EARLIER batch could mean we are starting to desynchronize.
//FACT: The server will always have less of our input than we do.
//FACT: We may see input from other players before the server processes it.
//FACT: However, if it's missing from a batch, the server hasn't seen it yet.
//FACT: We may get server update pushes older than our input and/or older than the newest batch we have.
//FACT: We may have different orderings.
//FACT: we can determine the correct ordering and we all know the correct ordering of all input that made it into batches.

//Notes:
/*
Multiversus just relays input, it's all deterministic, and it records it.
At the end of the game, if clients disagree, it spins up a simulation and replays the inputs,
and uses that for the outcome (and presumably flags whoever disagreed for statistical detection).

	 * Conserved input streams record their last 8,192 inputs. Yes, that's a few megs across all streams. No, it doesn't really seem to matter.
	 * Currently, this is for debug purposes, but we can use it with some additional features to provide a really expressive
	 * model for rollback at a SUPER granular level if needed. UE has existing rollback tech, though so...
	 *
	 * These streams are designed for single reader, single producer, but it is hypothetically possible to have a format where you do
	 * single producer, single consumer, multiple observer. I don't recommend that, due to the need to mark records as played for cosmetics.
	 *
	 * It is possible that an observer might end up with a stale view of if a record's cosmetic effects have been applied, in this circumstance.
	 * This is DONE DURING THE GET. That can lead to an unholy mess. If you need an observer, ensure that it does not regard cosmetics as important
	 * AND use a PEEK.
