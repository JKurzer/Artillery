//dynamic constructed statemachine for matching patterns in action records to triggering abilities.
//extends the Ability System Component to remove even more boiler plate and smoothly integrate
//Artillery's threaded input model.

//The fire control machine manages activation patterns.
//it does not interact directly with input or run the patterns itself.
// 
// Patterns are always run by the artillery worker thread. events generated by pattern success flow through Dispatch.
//
//Each Fire Control Machine manages attributes and abilities, with all abilities being ordered into ArtilleryGuns.
//This additional constraint, combined with the pattern system, allows us to better build abilities that are general
//but NOT abstract. Our goal is to reduce boilerplate and improve ease of use, not necessarily increase code reuse.
//We HOPE that will happen, but bear this set of priorities in mind while dealing with Guns and FireControl.

//As a final word of warning, it has been our extensive experience that generic is better than general, and concrete
//is better than abstract. The urge towards pattern-before-problem programming is deadly.
