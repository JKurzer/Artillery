/**
 * This is the backbone of artillery, and along with the ArtilleryGuns and ArtilleryFireControlMachines, 
 * this is most of what any other code will see of artillery in C++. Blueprints will mostly not even see that
 * as they are already encapsulated in the artillerygun's ability sequencer. Abilities merely need to be uninstanced,
 * only modify attributes tracked in Artillery, and use artillery bp nodes where possible.
 * 
 * No unusual additional serialization or similar is required for determinism. I hope.
 * 
 * For an organized view of the code, start by understanding that most work is done outside the gamethread.
 * Bristlecone handles network inputs, Cabling handles keymapping and local inputs. Artillery handles outcomes.
 * 
 * Here's the core rule:
 * 
 * Core gameplay simulation happens in the ArtilleryBusyWorker at about 120hz.
 * Anything that cannot cause the core gameplay sim to become desyncrhonized happens in the game thread.
 * Surprisingly, this means _most things flow through UE normally and happen on the game thread & render threads._
 * 
 * Our goal is that cosmetic ability components, animation, IK, particle systems, cloth, and really, almost everything
 * happens in UE normally. Rollbacks don't happen in the broader UE system at all, and in fact, most of UE acts like its
 * running in a pretty simple Iris push config.
 * 
 * Artillery just pushes transform and ability updates upward as needed. That's a big just, but it really is a narrow scope.
 * 
 * Iris does normal replication on a slow cadence as a fall back and to provide attribute sync reassurances.
