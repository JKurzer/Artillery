# Artillery

Guns, GAS, and shields!

Complexity and access management primitives married to the core set of basic weapon abilities used to bind to a weapon actor. 
Built on top of GAS. And yes, I know the beetle is actually the bombardier beetle, formally.

https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation is a really useful place to start for understanding GAS. We're using it very slightly differently,
in a more composition oriented way that'll hopefully ease the dependency management and granularity issues we ran into at Riot if we go
with using Game Feature Plugins.
